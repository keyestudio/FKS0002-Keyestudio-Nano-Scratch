![FKS0002-01](./media/FKS0002-01.jpg)

### **1. Description**

This starter kit is a programmable tool specialized for kids above 6.

In total, we provide 15 modules and sensors(such as LED, buttons, LCD, photosensor, sound sensor, IR remote, temperature and humidity sensor) as well as 30 projects(like mini lamp, counter, responder, timebomb and meteorological station), in which you will enjoy spending your day.

For each project, we offer you two programming language: Arduino C and graphical programming on the basis of KidsBlock Desktop, which is beneficial to cultivate preliminary programming logic.

### **2. Features**

**1. Easy wiring:** The wiring of VCC and GND are removed, so there is no need to worry about burning sensors and modules.

**2. Multiple functions:** Nano/ESP32 development board are both available as the control board; 15 sensors are integrated; The VCC of 3.3V/5V can be adjusted via DIP switch when connecting to external power supply.

**3. Simple structure:** With 6mm dual-pass copper pillars and acrylic boards, the installation is convenient meanwhile it avoids you being scratched by welding points.

**4. High expansibility:** Though in-built VCC is provided on modules in this kit, lead-out pins of VCC and GND are reserved to expand for external modules.

**5. Underlying code learning:** In view of green hands, graphical programming is used to cultivate programming logic and build foundation. Considering of well-grounded persons, C language is used combining with hardware working principles to know deeper on underlying code. 

### **3. Parameters**

- **Working voltage:** 5V / 3.3V
- **DC power supply:** 7-12V

- **USB power supply:**  5V
- **Working current:** ≥35mA

- **Working temperature:** –10°C ~ +65°C
